# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor for Horiseon 

## Your Task 
This weekâ€™s homework required us to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. For example, check that all links are functioning correctly. You can also increase the efficiency of the CSS by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

To improve the accessibility of this webpage, I changed the HTML file to ensure that elements were semantic and followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. I also made sure class and id selectors were used properly throughout the code. In addition, I added alt attributes to all images on the page and added a webpage title to the <head> section. I then changed the existing CSS file to make sure it corresponded with the changes I made to the HTML file. I also consolidated certain selectors and properties in the CSS and added comments.
