# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor for Horiseon 

For assignment #1, I was tasked with **Refactoring** Horiseon's existing webpage (improving it without changing what it does) to make the page more accessible. An increasingly important consideration for businesses, web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies like video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Accessibility is good for businessâ€”for one thing, accessible sites rank higher in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation, which might arise if people with disabilities can't access a website. 

To improve the accessibility of this webpage, I changed the HTML file to ensure that elements were semantic and followed a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. I also made sure class and id selectors were used properly throughout the code. In addition, I added alt attributes to all images on the page and added a webpage title to the <head> section. I then changed the existing CSS file to make sure it corresponded with the changes I made to the HTML file. I also consolidated certain selectors and properties in the CSS and added comments.
